## Projects

### 1. Synthetic Dataset Generator with Prompt-Based System
![DataCraftor Logo](imgs/DataCraftorLogo.png){: width="400" }

DataCraftor is an paltform designed to simplify synthetic dataset generation and processing. It leverages LLMs (Large Language Models) to help users create datasets based on structured prompts, tailored to meet specific requirements. The platform also supports real-time data exploration, enabling users to interact with and query datasets for immediate insights. Additionally, DataCraftor offers dynamic data processing capabilities, allowing users to upload their own datasets for refinement, cleaning, or augmentation.

To ensure flexibility across workflows, DataCraftor provides multiple export options. Users can export datasets in commonly used code formats such as Python, SQL, and R, or as files in CSV and JSON formats.
